# GradleUp Community Channels

## GitHub Issues

Each project has GitHub issues.
Please raise bugs and discuss feature requests there.

## Slack

We have a `#gradleup` public channel on the
[Gradle Community Slack](https://community.gradle.org/contributing/community-slack/).
For now, this chat is used for all development and end user discussions.
In the future, we may introduce more channels.

The following components have custom channels:

- `#dev-shadow-plugin` - development of the Shadow Plugin.
