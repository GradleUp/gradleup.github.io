Subscribe to the GradleUp news, join the discussions on Slack and GitHub issues.
All code and non-code contributions are welcome!

## News

We have a blog on [blog.gradleup.com](https://blog.gradleup.com/).
There we will be publishing the key updates on what's up in GradleUp.
You can also subscribe to the blog as a [newsletter](https://blog.gradleup.com/newsletter)
or [RSS feed](https://blog.gradleup.com/rss.xml).

Guest posts by GradleUp users and component maintainers are welcome, too!
Reach out to us on Slack if interested

## GitHub Issues

Each project repository has GitHub Issues enabled.
Please raise bugs and discuss feature requests there.

## Slack

We have a `#gradleup` public channel on the
[Gradle Community Slack](https://community.gradle.org/contributing/community-slack/).
This chat is used for real-time development and end user discussions.
For longer-term discussions, e.g. architecture proposals or feature requests,
it is highly recommended to use GitHub Issues in the respective repositories.

The following components have custom channels:

- `#dev-shadow-plugin` - development of the Shadow Plugin.

In the future, we may introduce more channels.

## Slack Archive

Gradle Community Slack uses the free plan,
so the history of `#gradleup` is limited to 3 months.
You can find the communications archive for previous dates
[here](https://www.linen.dev/s/gradle-community/c/gradleup).
