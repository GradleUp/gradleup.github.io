# GradleUp Community Channels

[![Slack: GradleUp on the Gradle Community Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/Slack-%23gradleup-brightgreen?style=flat&logo=slack)](./#slack)

## GitHub Issues

Each project repository has GitHub Issues enabled.
Please raise bugs and discuss feature requests there.

## Slack

We have a `#gradleup` public channel on the
[Gradle Community Slack](https://community.gradle.org/contributing/community-slack/).
This chat is used for real-time development and end user discussions.
For longer-term discussions, e.g. architecture proposals or feature requests,
it is highly recommended to use GitHub Issues in the respective repositories.

The following components have custom channels:

- `#dev-shadow-plugin` - development of the Shadow Plugin.

In the future, we may introduce more channels.

## Slack Archive

Gradle Community Slack uses the free plan,
so the history of `#gradleup` is limited to 3 months.
You can find the communications archive for previous dates
[here](https://www.linen.dev/s/gradle-community/c/gradleup).
