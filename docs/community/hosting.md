# Hosting New Projects on GradleUp

New Gradle related projects can be potentially hosted on GradleUp.
It includes transferring the project to GradleUp,
and ensuring quality and sustainability of the project.

## Hosting Process

At the moment, there is no documented process for hosting new components.
The criteria below are general practices,
and they will be extended over time.
The decision will be made by the [GradleUp Team](./team.md) on a case by case basis.

To request the transfer and initiate the discussion, contact the team.

## Criteria

The general criteria for hosting a project are:

- The project has value to the ecosystem and fits into the GradleUp scope.
- The project must be open source and licensed under one of the
  [OSI-approved open source licenses](https://opensource.org/).
- The project follows the best practices for creating Gradle plugins and components.
- The requesting contributors are willing to continue maintenance of the project
  after the transfer.
- The requesting contributors are willing to ensure sustainability of their project,
  and fine with it being transferred to another maintainer should they become inactive.
