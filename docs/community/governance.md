# GradleUp Governance Charter

## What is GradleUp?

GradleUp is a volunteer-driven umbrella GitHub organization
focusing on simplifying developer experience with [Gradle Build Tool (a.k.a. Gradle)](https://gradle.org/),
in particular for Java, Kotlin and Android projects.
We host components and ensure their long-term sustainability.

Our scope includes all things that help to achieve great user and developer experience when working with Gradle.
It includes but not limited to plugins, developer tools, integrations, documentation or community content.

## Formal Side

The GradleUp organization is a volunteer driven community
operating in a public interest in a non-profit mode and
providing no commercial services.
There is no formal legal entity behind GradleUp.

## Structure

The project is led by a small team of passionate Gradle users and contributors.
This [GradleUp Team](./team.md) is to be considered as a top governance and steering entity for the project.

The project also includes maintainers and contributors.

## Roles

* **Contributor** - any individual who participates in the community and 
  adds value to in one form or another,
  including but not limited to code, documentation, automation, advocacy or
  community support.
* **Team Member** -
  A GradleUp contributor listed on the [GradleUp Team page](./team.md).
  They participate in the project steering as whole.
  New team members are added by the decision of the current team members.
* **Org Admin** - A team member with administrative access to the GitHub
  organization and/or other community resources.
  Permissions and access are granted based on the decision of the current team members.
* **Maintainer** - A GradleUp contributor who maintains a component hosted on GradleUp.
  It includes roles _Triage_ or above.
  Components may explicitly or implicitly introduce more Maintainer sub-roles.
  
## Decision Making

The decisions are made by the [GradleUp Team](./team.md) based on consensus and common sense.
We intend to make decision making fast and light-weight,
with minimum overhead when a consensus exists.

Most of the decisions are discussed and made in
[public communication channels](./participate.md).
It is expected that all contributors and end users are able to participate to the decisions.
Some exceptional decisions,
for example Code of Conduct discussions,
may be done in private.

## Components Governance

### Component Ownership

_Maintainers_ have full control of technical decisions and processes within their components.
Apart from the requirements documented in the [Hosting Guidelines](./hosting.md),
_Maintainers_ are free to define the governance processes within their repositories,
to add collaborators to the projects,
or to implement automation and release process as they deem beneficial.

All hosted components remain a subject to [GradleUp Code of Conduct](../../org/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
and they must adhere to some security and hosting rules documented in the [Hosting Guidelines](./hosting.md).
The recommendations and best practices remain optional.

### Hosting New Components

New Gradle related projects can be potentially hosted on GradleUp.
It includes transferring the project to GradleUp,
and ensuring quality and sustainability of the project.
See the [Hosting New Projects page](./hosting.md) for more information.

### Transferring Ownership

Should a _Maintainer_ explicitly move-on and put a project for adoption,
or become unresponsive for a long period of time,
the _GradleUp Team_ can re-assign ownership of the project to ensure the
continuity of the component.
A best possible effort should be made to reach out to the maintainer beforehand.

## Open Source Commitment

In GradleUp, we are committed to open source.
We intend to do most of the work in public,
and to have publicly open communication channels to discuss the changes and the strategy.

We reserve the right to do some work in private when it is required to
ensure confidentiality and safety of GradleUp contributors and users.
Possible examples include:

* Vulnerability reporting, security patches and advisory preparetion.
  See the [Security Policy](../../org/SECURITY.md)
* Code of Conduct escalations, investigation and follow-ups
* Distribution of physical assets like swag
