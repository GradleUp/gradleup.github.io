# Hello, World!

üêòüéà GradleUp, a volunteer-driven umbrella GitHub org focused on better Java, Kotlin and Android developer experience with Gradle, got a new website!

<!-- more -->

## What is GradleUp?

GradleUp is a volunteer-driven umbrella GitHub organization
focusing on simplifying developer experience with [Gradle Build Tool (a.k.a. Gradle)](https://gradle.org/),
in particular for Java, Kotlin and Android projects.
We host components and ensure their long-term sustainability.

Our scope includes all things that help to achieve great user and developer experience when working with Gradle.
It includes but not limited to plugins, developer tools, integrations, documentation or community content.

## So, a Website?

The first release includes:

- Listing of the [GradleUp Projects](../../projects/README.md)
- Initial [Governance Charter](../../docs/community/governance.md)
- [Contributing](../../docs/community/participate.md)and
  [New Component Hosting](../../docs/community/hosting.md) guidelines.
- And this blog!

## Under the Hood

The site is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/),
[MkDocs Multirepo Plugin](https://github.com/jdoiro3/mkdocs-multirepo-plugin/tree/main),
and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material).
For development, everything is powered by Dev Containers and GitHub Actions.
As all other resources, the site is open source and open for contributions and new ideas.
Check out the [Contributing Guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

We‚Äôre looking forward to establishing the public communication channels, and onboarding more plugins, developer tools and other cool Gradle things.
Adventure is out there!

## Credits

This site is a team effort.
We embed documentation created by many contributors to
[GradleUp Projects](../../projects/README.md).
Also, kudos to [Oleg Nenashev](https://github.com/oleg-nenashev) for working on this website and the community foundations, and welcome to the team!
